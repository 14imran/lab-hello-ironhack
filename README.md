# React | ReactJS Landing Page

## Introduction

We just learned the basics about creating a **Hello World** app in ReactJS, so we will use this exercise to re-do what we just learned (and add some style, to make our UX/UI classmates happier).

## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands

  ```
  git add .

  git push origin master
  ```

## Instructions

### Iteration 1 - Create the App

Let's start with the basic, inside the folder init a `package.json`, and all the folders you will need for the project: `dist` and `src`. Also, remember to create an `index.html` file, where you will have the entry point of the application.

```
react-hello-world
│   README.md
|   index.html
|   package.json
└───dist
└───public
└───src
```

#### Babel and Webpack

Now we need to add the necessary to compile the project. Easy peasy, install both, `Babel` and `Webpack`.

### Iteration 2 - React Creation

You are ready to start creating your ReactJS app. First, add the packages needed. And then create an `index.js` file inside the `src` folder.

```bash
$ npm install react@16.3.2 and react-dom@16.3.2. 
```

## Iteration 3 - First Landing Page

Finally, let's create our landing page. In the `public` folder, you will find all the assets you need to recreate the following landing page:

For now, don't worry about creating more than one component, we will cover that in the following lessons!
